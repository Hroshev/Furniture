<template id="privacyPolicy">
    <p>Last Updated January 29, 2022</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of this Website and any content, products or services made available
        from or through this website including any sub domains thereof ("Website""). The Website is made available
        by (Hereinafter referred to as "Company"). By visiting this Website and requesting information, products or
        services offered on or through this Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as they may be
        amended from time to time. As Company updates or expands its Website, services or products, this Privacy
        Policy may change and the changes are effective upon posting. Please check back frequently for updates as it
        is your sole responsibility to be aware of changes. Company does not provide notice of changes in any manner
        other than by posting the changes at this Website. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of,
        the Website Terms and Conditions which govern your use of this Website in general. This Website is intended
        for users who are located in the United States of America. The Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the
        laws of the United States.</p>
    <p>PURPOSE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY. This Policy describes the information collection, use, and dissemination
        practices of Company, its parent, subsidiaries and registered d/b/a companies (Collectively Referred herein
        after as "Company") and all related websites owned or registered to Company. It governs Company's right to
        collect, use, store and disclose information provided by You on its (a) this Website, (b) Company's other
        Websites, (c) on various Third Party websites, and (d) Company's other information collection and
        distribution practices, including the acquisition of your information from and to Third Parties. Company is
        not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or applications
        which company does not own or control. By providing us with Personal Information about yourself on our
        Website or in the course of using our services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information,
        and any other data we acquire about you from third-party service providers for commercial use.</p>
    <p>INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES. 1.0. Collection of Information.</p>
    <p>1.1. User Direct Information. Each time you provide or transmit information via the Website, Company may
        obtain and collect personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address,
        mailing address, social security number, credit card information, bank account information and telephone or
        cell phone number (collectively referred to as "Personal Information").</p>
    <p>1.2. Survey Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily complete a
        Company survey, order form, or a registration page either online by using the internet or offline by
        providing this information through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This information may be
        collected by surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties. This method of
        collection is collectively known as a "Survey." In such Surveys, Company or a third party may ask you to
        provide Personal Information including your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers
        (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status,
        occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
        information as may be requested from time to time. Company may also collect such information concerning you
        from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from the Website or
        Surveys. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey
        Information to Company or a third party.</p>
    <p>1.3. Third Party Information. Company may collect Personal Information from you when you provide
        information to a third party and Company subsequently acquires or uses the information provided by the third
        party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip
        code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,
        education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such
        other information you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company seeks
        assurances from the third party that you agreed to provide and have such information acquired by Company. If
        you did not give express permission, or you would like to remove your permission, you may suppress all of
        your information by sending notification to us at sales@USFinancial.com.</p>
    <p>1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information. Other occasions when Company obtains information
        from you include: (1) when you claim a prize or seek to redeem an offer by Company or by a third party; (2)
        when you request assistance through Company's customer service department; and (3) when you voluntarily
        subscribe to a Company service or newsletter.</p>
    <p>1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. Company currently uses cookie and web
        beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in
        its database. Additionally, Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future. (a)
        Cookies. "Cookies" are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store
        small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us
        in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past
        visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your
        preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and
        report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your
        interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable
        cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to
        accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about
        cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Company's
        websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is a programming code that can be used
        to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a
        database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This
        allows Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits
        for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web
        beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in
        Company's database. (c) IP Addresses. Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your
        behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
        interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may
        include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to
        (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your
        Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service
        Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
        permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers,
        collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual
        by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the
        Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are
        using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those
        websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles. Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous
        data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance,
        Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating
        system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie
        preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal
        Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Analysis. Data
        Analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of Company. (f) New Technology.
        The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a
        result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of
        new technology.
    </p>
    <p>1.6. No Information Collected from Children. Company will never knowingly collect any Personal Information
        about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal
        Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its
        database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to
        disclose to third parties.</p>
    <p>1.7. Credit Card Information and Bank Account Information. Company may, in certain instances, collect
        credit card numbers, bank account information and related information when an individual places an order on
        Company's Website. When the credit card or bank account information is submitted to Company, such
        information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Company will use the credit card
        information or bank account information for purposes of processing and completing the transaction you
        requested on the Website, and the credit card information or bank account information will be disclosed to
        third parties as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.</p>
    <p>2.0. Use of Personal Information.</p>
    <p>2.1. General Use. The following paragraphs describe how Company currently uses Personal Information, but
        Company may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, Company may update this policy from time
        to time. Company may use Personal Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email
        advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, mobile marketing, online banner advertising, and
        package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
    <p>2.2. Disclosure of Information to Participating Service Providers of Services. Company will disclose your
        Personal Information in order to effect or carry out any transaction that you have requested of us or as
        necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SELL, RENT OR TRANSFER
        YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO our participating service providers, as authorized by you, which include:
        lenders, agents, and debt management firms FOR ANY PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. We prohibit the sale or
        transfer of personal information to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the opportunity
        to opt-out (See Opt-Out below). We may share your personally identifiable information with affiliated
        companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of Company. We may send
        personally identifiable information about you to non-affiliated companies that are not directly or
        indirectly controlled by, or under common control of, Company. These non-affiliated companies may contact
        you (via email, direct marketing, or telemarketing) directly about (i) your information/service requests
        through this website and/or (ii) their own products and services in accordance with their own privacy
        policies.</p>
    <p>2.3. Email and Unsubscribe Policy. Company uses Personal Information to provide third party promotional
        offers by email to individuals. Company may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email
        recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions
        at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company's
        email lists, a person must send an email to sales@USFinancial.com</p>
    <p>2.4. Content of Email Messages. You may receive certain commercial email messages sent by third parties for
        products which may be of interest to you. In such case, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" and
        the email will have a method at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe from that Advertiser. Company is not
        responsible for third party emails sent to you.</p>
    <p>2.5. Solicited Email. Company only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Website to receive
        email from Company or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website to receive email from Third
        Parties. As such, Company does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, United States statutes
        requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Company's email messages.</p>
    <p>2.6. Targeted Advertising. Company may use Personal Information to target advertising to an individual.
        When an individual is using the Internet, Company uses Technology Information to associate an individual
        with that person's Personal Information, and Company attempts to show advertising for products and services
        in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
        Information, and otherwise. Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail,
        telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>
    <p>2.7. Telemarketing. Company may use Personal Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to
        individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. You may have your
        telephone number or cell phone number listed on a state or federal do not call registry. By registering and
        using this Site, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for
        purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding that
        your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, you have authorized
        us to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or
        requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement media
        made available by us (e.g., email marketing), you agree that such action shall constitute a purchase, an
        inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you
        may be contacted via email, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance
        with the ATSR. We may use Personal Information to provide the services you've requested, including services
        that display customized content and advertising.</p>
    <p>2.8. Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide to Company is a wireless e-mail address, you
        agree to receive messages at such address from Company or its business associates (unless and until you have
        elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this
        policy). You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages. You represent
        that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and
        that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.</p>
    <p>2.9. Short Message Service. Company may make available a service through which you can receive messages on
        your wireless device via short message service ("SMS Service"). Data obtained from you in connection with
        this SMS service may include your name, address, cell phone number, your provider's name, and the date,
        time, and content of your messages. You represent that you are 18 years of age and the owner or authorized
        user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the
        applicable charges. In addition to any fee of which you are notified your provider's standard messaging
        rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence. All charges are billed by and payable
        to your mobile service provider. Company will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS
        messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services
        are provided on an AS IS basis. Company may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the
        course of your use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS
        Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may
        provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and
        other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are
        governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless
        systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not
        guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any
        lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and
        providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also
        access the content of your account and wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and
        resolving technical problems and service-related complaints. You may remove your information from Company's
        database. If you remove your information from Company's database it will no longer be used by Company for
        secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by Company or third parties to send promotional
        correspondence to you. You may remove your information by sending your request in writing via email to
        sales@USFinancial.com or by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received.
    </p>
    <p>2.10. Use of Technology Information. Company may use Technology Information (1) to match a person's
        Personal Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Personal Information to make
        and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to
        determine which areas of Company's websites are most frequently visited. This information helps Company to
        better understand the online habits of individuals so that Company can target advertising and promotions to
        them.</p>
    <p>2.11. Profiles of Individuals. Company may use Personal Information to make a profile of an individual. A
        profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources
        of Personal Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
    <p>3.0. Other Use of Personal Information. Company may use your Personal Information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <p>3.1. Public Forums. When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as a chat room,
        bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through our
        Website, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public and will not be
        considered "Personal Information" for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we recommend that
        you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other
        information that would enable other users to locate you or your financial information on these areas of our
        Website. Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal identity.
    </p>
    <p>3.2. Third Party Offers. Company may provide your Personal Information to third parties with whom they have
        a business relationship for the purposes of securing the services and products you have requested or provide
        you with additional marketing materials from which you may choose additional products or services. Company
