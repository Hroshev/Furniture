# Furniture

npm run dev

npm run build


The first website on the Gulp

I use:
-swiper
-webpack
-imgmin
-webp
...

I need to focus JS. Otherwise, I'm happy with the result.
The website has modal windows, a progress bar, a burger menu, and navigation. Dynamic post output via JavaScript. The site is adapted to any size device
